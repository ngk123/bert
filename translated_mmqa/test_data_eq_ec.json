Indo-Gangetic plains and later marched towards northwest. Chandragupta soon conquered the whole region of Punjab. Seleucus Nicator, a Greek general of Alexander, held some of the land in the extreme north. Therefore, Chandragupta fought a long battle against him and at last defeated him around 305 B.C. and a treaty was signed. According to this treaty, Seleucus Nicator ceded the trans-Indus territories -namely Aria (Heart), Arachosia (Kandahar), Gedrosia (Baluchistan) and Paropanishae (Kabul) - to the Mauryan Empire and in exchange Chandragupta made a gift of 500 elephants to Seleucus. He (Seleucus) also gave his daughter in marriage to the Mauryan prince or it is supposed that Chandragupta married Seleucus's daughter (a Greek Macedonian princess) as a gift from Seleucus to formalize an alliance. In this way Chandragupta took his control over Indus region, some part of which is now in modern Afghanistan. \tFirst of all Chandragupta established his power in Indo-Gangetic plains and later marched towards northwest.
